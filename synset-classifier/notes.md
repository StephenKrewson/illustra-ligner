Rebuilding illustra-ligner

Motivation
----------
The code that I wrote for this project was horribly confusing. Not only was I switching between Python and Matlab, but each of the various scripts lacked one clear purpose. As far as the data images themselves, the naming and folder conventions were unclear. In fact, clarifying how the data should be stored was the first step.
